# Detailed Design: Data Pipeline Overview
## Audience
This write-up targets readers without a technical background who want a clear understanding of how the data pipeline operates from start to finish.

### 1. Ingestion: Getting Raw Data
Where data comes from: The pipeline can pull information from multiple sources (files, databases, APIs, etc.).

How it arrives: A lightweight “collector” script or service fetches raw files or records and drops them into a secure staging area (either a cloud bucket or on-prem storage).

Why it matters: Establishes a single, reliable entry point for all incoming data.

### 2. Validation: Checking the Raw Input
Automated data checks: A validation routine scans the new data to make sure fields are present and values fall within expected ranges (e.g., dates are real dates, amounts are positive).

Handling issues: Any problematic records are flagged and quarantined; the pipeline keeps only the good data moving forward.

### 3. Transformation: Cleaning and Reshaping
Standardization: Dates, currency, and string formats are normalized so everything looks consistent.

Enrichment: Additional fields—such as computed metrics or joined lookups from reference tables—are added.

Output format: The data is restructured into a clean, analytics-friendly layout (often tabular/columnar), ensuring downstream tools can read it easily.

### 4. Storage: Persisting the Curated Data
Destination: The transformed data is written to a structured data store (e.g., a database, data warehouse, or curated storage bucket).

Retention strategy: Versioning or partitioning keeps snapshots by date, making it possible to revisit historical states.

Access control: Permissions limit who can view or modify the stored data.

### 5. Delivery: Making Results Available
Dashboards and reports: Business users access curated data via BI dashboards, scheduled reports, or ad-hoc queries.

APIs and integrations: Other systems can consume the processed data through well-defined interfaces.

### 6. Monitoring & Alerting
Health checks: Automated monitors track data freshness, pipeline runtimes, and validation errors.

Alerts: If something goes wrong (late data, validation failure), the responsible team is notified promptly.

### 7. Logging & Auditing
Traceability: Every run logs its inputs, transformations, and outputs, so changes can be traced back for audits or debugging.

Reproducibility: With logs and version control, the pipeline can be rerun for specific timeframes to reproduce past results.

### 8. Governance & Security
Privacy controls: Sensitive fields may be masked or encrypted.

Compliance: The pipeline’s processes align with relevant regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) as needed.

### 9. Automation & Scheduling
Orchestration: A scheduler (e.g., cron, Airflow) runs the pipeline at regular intervals or in response to new data arrivals.

Dependencies: Tasks run in a pre-defined order, ensuring each stage starts only after prerequisites succeed.

### 10. Scalability & Maintenance
Scaling up: As data grows, the system can add more computing resources or distribute workloads.

Maintainability: Code is version-controlled, and changes are peer-reviewed to keep the pipeline reliable.
